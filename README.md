# Motor sequence learning

This repository contains MATLAB code and data related to the Berlot, Popp & Diedrichsen (2020) paper "A critical re-evaluation of fMRI signatures of motor sequence learning". 



The following toolboxes are needed to use the code:

- MATLAB R2015b (version used in data processing)
- SPM12 (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm)
- Dataframe toolbox (https://github.com/jdiedrichsen/dataframe)
- PCM toolbox (https://github.com/jdiedrichsen/pcm_toolbox)
- RSA toolbox (https://github.com/rsagroup/rsatoolbox)
- Plotlib toolbox (https://github.com/nejaz1/plotlib)
